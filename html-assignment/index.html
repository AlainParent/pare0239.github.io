            <h2>About Me</h2> 
            <p>My name is Alain Parent and I am a proud father 
            of <em>3 beautiful children</em>. I got a girl friend named Josee and she helped me 
             make this wonderful 
            decision to go back to shcool in Interactive Media Design for the next 2 years. It's the 1<sup>st</sup> time I go to college since my teenage years.
            I love web design even if this is a hard course for me.</p>
            <p>I live in Gatineau <abbr title=Quebec>Qc</abbr> Canada, 15 minuits from downtown Ottawa. Am not happy that we are online for this course but I have to admit that at <strong>-30<sup></sup>Â°</strong>, I enjoy listening to prof rob in my living room. It's hot and cosy and I like it.</p>
